## Geometric Area Calculator

### Project Overview

This project implements a Python program, `area.py`, which utilizes the Agent capabilities of the LangChain framework to create tools for calculating geometric areas. The program includes two custom tools: one for calculating the area of a circle and another for calculating the area of a triangle. By using different prompts, the Agent can invoke these tools and successfully calculate the area of user-specified shapes.

### Technologies Used
*   Python
*   LangChain


### Product Embedding Generation and Retrieval System

### Project Overview

This project implements a system for generating and retrieving product embeddings. It utilizes the **SentenceTransformer** library to create vector embeddings from product descriptions and stores these embeddings in a **Qdrant** database. The system efficiently retrieves specific product information based on product IDs, demonstrating the application of vector embeddings in information retrieval.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- SentenceTransformer
- Qdrant

### Features

- **Generate Product Embeddings**: Create and store vector embeddings from product descriptions in the Qdrant database.
- **Retrieve Product Information**: Fetch specific product information from the Qdrant database using product IDs.
- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Leverage vector embedding technology to enhance query efficiency and accuracy.
